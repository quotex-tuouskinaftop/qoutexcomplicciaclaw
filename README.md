# Is Quotex Safe or Not?

## What is Quotex?

Quotex is an unregulated, offshore binary options platform that lets you
trade over 200 assets across various financial instruments, including
commodities, crypto, stocks, and currency pairs. The broker is focusing
on beginner traders and claims to be an "Innovative platform for smart
investments" with the promise of easy profits, while "making online
trading comfortable and safe".

## Is Quotex a Scam?

Yes, we believe that Quotex is a scam and you should not open an account
with them.

Their trading platform, trading tools and service agreement are designed
to make traders lose money in the long run. Quotex is not regulated by
any financial authorities so it is not a safe and legit broker and
nobody is protecting traders\' interest against shady, unfair business
practices.

## Why We Think Quotex is Not a Safe Broker

-   Not regulated at all
-   It\'s easy to lose money while trading at Quotex
-   Misleading marketing tactics and trading tools
-   Bad reputation, many negative user reviews

## Is Quotex Legal?

Quotex is not legal in most countries like the USA, India, Pakistan,
Singapore, Philippines or the European Economic Area, because the broker
is not registered with the local regulatory organizations.

Quotex is technically not illegal and not explicitly banned in South
Africa, but it\'s not regulated by the Financial Sector Conduct
Authority (FSCA), so your capital is not protected, if you are a South
African trader.

## Trading Platform Overview

-   The Quotex trading platform has the usual clean, very intuitive
    interface optimized for beginner traders, just like the platform of
    other typical binary option bokers\'.
-   Quotex offers 5 - 30 second, 1 - 30 minute, and 1- 4 hour trades.
    The profits that you can earn vary across different securities,

-   Quotex hosts tournaments that enable you to earn bonuses and prizes
    by competing with other traders. All participants are given the same
    amount of virtual funds that you will use in the event. Winning
    prizes vary depending on which pool you entered, but Quotex also
    host events that will let you win up to 3000 - 5000 USD with 1 USD -
    10 USD entry fees.

## Mobile App

Quotex only offers an official Android App for mobile traders, but it
also faces technical issues, particularly with depositing funds. Quotex
does not have an iOS app, a desktop app or an official APK version you
could download.

So if you really want to trade on Quotex, we suggest you to use the use
the \[official web
platform\](https://eseta.org.za/go/quotex/web-version/ "Quotex
Download - web version") instead of downloading unverified or buggy
apps, because it offers a technically secure, stable, and user-friendly
trading environment.

## Account Opening

The account opening process is very simple at Quotex. If you want to
open a trading account with them \*\*despite our warning,\*\* go to
their official website or download their mobile app from the Google Play

4.  You can then input your complete name, date of birth, and address on
    the accounts tab later.

## Account Types

Quotex offers two account types, a live account for real money traders
and a free, \$10,000 demo account to try out their platform and practice
trading strategies. Here's an overview of each account type:

### Live Account

The live account provides you access to all features of the Quotex
trading platform, where you use your real money to make actual trades
for profit. The live account is comprised of three levels determined by
your maintaining balance:

-   \*\*Standard:\*\* beginners level that doesn't require maintaining
    balance. 
-   \*\*Pro:\*\* casual traders level requiring 4 000+ GBP, 4 700+ EUR,
    or 5000+ USD of balance. Pro level provides +2% profit increase with
    more market promotions than the standard tier.
-   \*\*VIP:\*\* professional traders level requiring 8 000+ GBP, 9 400+
    EUR, or 10 000+ USD of balance. VIP level provides +4% profit
    increase with the best market promotions and overall benefits. 

### Demo Account

The Quotex demo account allows you to test out the binary options
trading without risking your real money. This allows you to check the
tools featured and practice whether your strategies would work with
Quotex. The demo account provides you with virtual money for practice,
where you can use the same indicators and other charting tools on live
accounts. However, the Tournaments feature is not available in the demo,
so you would have to use your own money if you want to participate in
these events.    

## Money Deposit and Withdrawal

Quotex offers a wide selection of deposit and withdrawal methods
including credit cards (Visa and Mastercard), cryptocurrencies (e.g
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc), e-wallets (e.g Perfect Money) and local
payment options in emerging countries.

The minimum deposit at Quotex is 10 USD for most countries and payment
methods (just like at most binary options brokers) and the broker does
not charge any deposit or withdrawal fees.

To withdraw money from your Quotex accont, you have to use the same
payment method that you have used to deposit money. Money withdrawal
requests are usually processed quickly (typically between 1-5 business
days).
